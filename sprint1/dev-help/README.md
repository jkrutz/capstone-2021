<!-- SUMMARY -->
## Summary

To begin this Sprint, the team followed Unity's tutorial <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code">"Create with Code"</a>. This tutorial introduced C# fundamentals, basic player control, gameplay mechanics, sound and effects, and user interface creation. Examples of these units and the resulting example projects can be found <a href="/sprint1/tutorial/">here</a>. Following the tutorial walkthroughs, this team created a simple "Mario Game" that consists of the following features:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#Player-Controls">Player Control</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#Third-Person-Camera">Third Person Camera</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#Enemy-Players">Enemy Players</a>
  </li>
</ul>

These features provide a good base that will later be applied to the development of the base game. The base game provided by the end of this Sprint will feature these same features along side:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#Placeholder-Player-Model">Placeholder Player Model</a>

    <a href="#Testing-Arena">Testing Arena</a>

<!-- PRACTICE -->
## "Mario Game"

In order to practice the material learned in the Unity <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code">tutorial series</a>, a very rudimentary game was constructed that was inspired by the Nintendo Mario Classics. In this world, a player can move and jump and destroy enemies by jumping on them. The skills applied to this game are the base concepts that will also be applied to the game delivered at the end of this Sprint.

### Player Controls

Player movement is a core tenet of any interactive game. This enables a gamer to control where the on-screen avatar is located. We binded player movement to the most common controls, the W, A, S, D keys and the Up, Left, Down, Right keys. The SPACE bar when pressed applies an upward force to the player emulating a Jump.

### Third Person Camera

Third person camera mechanics increase useablility and level of comfort for our gamer base. When moving the mouse to the left or right, you are simulating a player looking left or right. With this feature added, moving feels "more natural" and less restrictive.

### Enemy Players

The presence of enemies makes the game interesting. You could take damage, you can deal damage, or you can run around the map away from the enemies. This game features waves of enemies (increasing with the progression of waves) that randomly spawn on the map. To make this game more like a "Mario Game," the way to kill an enemy is by simply jumping on their head. If an enemy collides with a player, the game ends and the player dies.


<!-- BASE GAME -->
## Sprint Game

Borrowing the concepts from the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code">Unity tutorial</a> and <a href="#Mario-Game">"Mario Game"</a>, this game incorporates features that expand on the magical universe that is unofficially "Wizard 404." Giving players an arena and bestowing magical fire-casting powers upon them, the capsule shaped players finally feel at home in our wizarding world.

### Placeholder Character

### Testing Arena

### Health System

### Grid Spell Casting System

### Fire Spell

### Title Screen & Menu
